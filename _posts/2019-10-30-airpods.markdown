Apple announced AirPods Pro, this time with noise cancellation feature,
so it made me sit down and write my own noise cancellation code.
Well, 

So I want to write an app that disables the background noises, using 
javascript, and in practicular, `Web Audio API`.
For that, I would like to go back and implement some basic mandatory code first,
like FFT.

# How Sound Works

## FFT or DFT

[The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to
Digital Signal Processing By Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.](http://www.dspguide.com/) is by far the greatest souce for learning about digital signal processing. I learn from 10 years ago while I had zero knowledge about the subject, and now after reading throught it again I can see how clear it is.

So this book is a really good start for someone who would like to dive in and not 
# How Noise Cancellation Works
The sound we hear is a wave.
Since waves can be accumulated, 
In the most basic way, noise cancellation works by
adding the negative amplitude to the original wave's amplutude, and there fore cancelling it.

There are few problems with that:
1. Processing time - how long does it take from the moment i 
sample the wave to produce the opposite wave.
