# Hila Shmuel
I have Bsc in **Computer science**, which I studied for during high school. I recently completed another Bsc in **Math & Physics**, just because I like it, and I think that a good solid mathematical background is a must for every person who identifies itself as a great thinker. 
 I love to solve riddles on my free time, read books (Iâ€™m a Harry Potter fan), and code. 
This blog mainly exists as a way to document my thoughts during the process of solving problems and making projects. 
Feel free to contact me.
