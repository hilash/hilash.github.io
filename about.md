# Hila Shmuel
<br/>

I have Bsc in **Computer science**, which i stuied for during high school.
I recently completed another Bsc in **Math & Physics**, just because i like it,
and I think that a good solid mathematical background is a must for every person who identify itself as a great thinker.
<br/>
I love the analytic side and on the other side, i like the practical side.
I can easliy sink into a math problem, yet can spend days coding something or figuring out how to exploit a system.
<br/>
I love to solve reedles on my free time, read books (I'm a Harry Potter fan),
and program stuff.
<br/>
I started writing this blog as a way to document my thoughts during the process of solving problems and making projects.
<br/>

feel free to contanct me for even a small conversation, i would appretiate that.
